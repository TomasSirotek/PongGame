## Gameplay
Main purpose of this game is to operate bat (paddle) with arrow keys "left" and "right" and bounce the pumpkin (ball) towards the bone (cpuPaddle).
Every 10th hit the level increases and the level as well. Bone has 3 stages of breaking and when 0 is hit it refils the player health. Player has 3 healts (hearts) and loosing all of them leads to game over. Goal making this game was to get used to OOP and working with java in general. We had so much fun working on this game so we hope it would be nice experience playing.
